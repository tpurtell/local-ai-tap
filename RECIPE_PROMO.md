## RDMA tools for DGX Spark and RoCE PCs

Move model weights, checkpoints, datasets, and container images between your local AI machines with [Local AI Tap](https://github.com/tpurtell/local-ai-tap):

- **`rdmasync`** — rsync-style file synchronization with RDMA bulk transfers.
- **`rdmapipe`** — stream command output over RDMA into a remote command, using SSH for authentication and orchestration.

Native **ARM64 and AMD64 binary bottles** are available for Linux, including DGX Spark. Homebrew installs the dependencies automatically.

**Install on both endpoints**, with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) already installed:

```bash
brew tap tpurtell/local-ai https://github.com/tpurtell/local-ai-tap.git

if brew commands | grep -qx trust; then
  brew trust --tap tpurtell/local-ai
fi

brew install tpurtell/local-ai/rdmapipe tpurtell/local-ai/rdmasync
```

Replace `spark` below with your machine’s SSH hostname or alias.

**Copy model files over RDMA:**

```bash
rdmasync -a --rdma=required \
  --rsync-path=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/rdmasync \
  ./models/ spark:~/models/
```

**Stream an ARM64 container image directly into a Spark:**

```bash
docker image save --platform linux/arm64 my-ai-image:latest |
  rdmapipe \
    --remote-path=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/rdmapipe \
    spark -- docker image load
```

The Docker example requires an ARM64 image locally and Docker access on both machines.

Use these tools on a trusted, configured RDMA/RoCE fabric with working Linux drivers and SSH access. Bulk RDMA traffic is not encrypted.
